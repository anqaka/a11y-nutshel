                According to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/), **1 in 4 adults has a form of disability**. This is 20% of the population that needs accessibility but currently, out of **350 million active websites** in the US (and over 1 Billion worldwide!), **less than 2% are accessible** to people with disabilities. This disproportion has created the ‘web accessibility gap’.(AccessiBe)

                <h3>Data from UK</h3>
                <Markdown>
                    The [Purple Pound](https://wearepurple.org.uk/the-purple-pound-infographic/) refers to the spending power of disabled households which is defined as a household in which at least one of the members have reported a disability. The key stand out statistics are as follows:
                    * More than 1 in 5 potential UK consumers are disabled.
                    * The number of disabled people in the UK is increasing – from 11.9 million (in 2014) to *13.3 million*.
                    * **The prevalence of disability rises with age**.
                    * **3 in 4 disabled people** and their families have *walked away* from a UK business citing **poor accessibility** and/or poor customer service.
                    * The *spending power* of disabled people and their household worldwide is currently estimated to be worth **$8 trillion**, increasing by 14% per annum. Only 10% of businesses have a targeted strategy for this huge market.
                    * There are 2 billion disabled people in the world that represents 37.5% of world’s population
                    * Nearly 1 in 5 working adults have a disability.
                    * 31% of the UK workforce have been formally diagnosed with a mental health issue. Yet only 13% of staff felt able to disclose a mental health issue to their workplace.
                    * 80% of disabled people have *hidden impairments*.
                    * In 2016, a survey found that more than 4 million people in the UK abandoned a retail website because of the barriers they found, taking with them an estimated spend of £11.75 billion. In 2019, that *lost business*, the ‘Click-Away Pound’, has grown to **£17.1 billion**.

                    **e-Commerce cited the most in digital accessibility lawsuits** - it  provides a reliable source for plaintiffs as the websites are complicated, change often, and are hard to be maintained for accessibility unless a company has a clear ongoing plan for testing and remediation.

                    Widgets and overlays don't resolve a problem: According Usablenet lawsuit report "Businesses **using accessibility widgets received more than 300 lawsuits**, a big YOY increase.

                    Lawsuits in 2021 (according to usablenet mid 2021 report) reflect the importance of considering accessibility for **all digital channels and content**. Accessibility on desktop websites dominates the number of lawsuits. *Mobile Apps continue to rise* along with a new trend in video-related claims. Video claims demand that all videos have closed caption and audio descriptions.
